# Python Banking Management System

This project is a modular command-line interface (CLI) application demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

# 🚀 Key Features

Account Management: Create unique bank accounts with initial deposits.
Transactions: Deposit and withdraw funds with validation checks.
Data Persistence: Uses the built-in json library to save account                 permanently to a local file (accounts.json).
Error Handling: Catches invalid inputs and insufficient funds using custom Python exceptions.
Modular Design: Code is split across three files for improved structure and readability.

# 📁 Files Explained
accounts.py: Contains the Account class and custom Exception definitions.
bankmanager.py: Manages the overall system, including loading/saving data and creating accounts.
main.py: The user interface and application entry point.

# ⚙️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.
Navigate to this folder in your terminal.
Run the main file using the Python interpreter:
bash
python main.py
Use code with caution.

The program will automatically create the accounts.json file when you create your first account.
